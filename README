OTPmail

One Time Pad encryption for Thunderbird

The goal of OTPmail is providing a simple user interface for mail encryption via the One Time Pad. The encryption itself is not done by the extension but handled by an external module (http://coeins.github.com/otpjar/). The project is currently in an early beta phase. Feel free to install and test it, but don't rely on it in productive scenarios.

For installation and usage instructions, see http://coeins.github.com/otpmail/
